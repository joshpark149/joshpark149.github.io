				<h2>About Josh</h2>
				<span class="byline">Welcome to my website! Here's some info
                    about me</span>
            </div>
            <p>I'm a sophomore studying math and computer science at Cornell,
                and I'm also pursuing a minor in music. You can usually find me rock climbing,
                playing League, eating unhealthy food, playing percussion, and reading math books.
                Lately I've also gotten into studying competitive programming. </p>
            <p>My academic interests lie in analysis, financial mathematics, and
                computing theory. I'm still trying to figure out my career interests, but
                as of now, I'm a consultant for CS 2110, and I work
                on grading assignments and holding office hours. I also know Python,
                Java, HTML, CSS, C/C++, and Javascript. </p>
            <p>
                I hope to expand this website with information on my personal projects and
                maybe turn it into a blog. If you're reading this, you're probably a recruiter
                or a friend who wants to make fun of my HTML. Either way, please excuse
                how underdeveloped this site is at the moment :)
            </p>
            <p>To the right are some photos of me, and below you can see info on the
                latest project I've been working on.</p>

                <h2>UBS Quant Hackathon 2020</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The UBS Hackathon is an online quantitative strategy and financial data
                science competition hosted by the Alphien platform. This competition
                was to outperform the S&P 500 index by developing a long only portfolio
                using a payout function, which returns an equally weighted investment
                in 50 stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The payout function takes in a pandas dataframe consisting of the close
                prices of stocks in the S&P 500 given a date, and it returns a pandas dataframe with dates
                we wish to rebalance and the desired weights for each company, which
                determines how much we invest. My methods truncate the dataframe of the
                close prices to only include our rebalancing dates. Then they fill each
                cell with a score, and then return a dataframe of allocations based on
                the highest scores on a given date.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first method was to simply compare a short SMA (simple moving average)
                with a long SMA. The larger the short SMA is proportional to the long SMA,
                the greater indicator that the stock's value is increasing. This method
                surprisingly gave consistent results around 14% annualized returns, as seen
                to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second method involved comparing the positive and negative directional
                indicators(+/-DI) using high and low prices to calculate the average true range.
                +DI indicates the presence of an uptrend, while -DI indicates the presence of a downtrend.
                I scored based on how much greater +DI was compared to -DI. This method was more volatile,
                but could reach up to 18% annualized returns in some cases.
